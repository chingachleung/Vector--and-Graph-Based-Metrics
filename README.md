# Vector--and-Graph-Based-Metrics
This repository includes data (AMR graphs & their sentences) used for the paper "Semantic Similarity as a Window into Vector- and Graph-Based Metrics" submitted to the GEM Workshop 2022. The sentences are taken from the [SemEval-2016 Semantic Textual Similarity Task](https://aclanthology.org/S16-1081.pdf)
